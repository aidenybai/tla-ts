    2212:0 Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 1 branches.
    2190:0 Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at <date>.
    2192:0 Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 3 total distinct states at (<date>)
    2267:0 Finished checking temporal properties in <time> at <date>
    2193:0 Model checking completed. No error has been found.
      Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
      because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
      calculated (optimistic):  val = 0.0
    2199:0 3 states generated, 3 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
    2194:0 The depth of the complete state graph search is 3.
    2268:0 The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 1 and the 95th percentile is 1).
