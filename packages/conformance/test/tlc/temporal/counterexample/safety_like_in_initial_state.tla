    2212:0 Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 1 branches.
    2190:0 Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at <date>.
    2116:1 Temporal property Prop was violated.
    2264:1 The following behavior constitutes a counter-example:
    2217:4 1: <Initial predicate>
    x = 0
    2199:0 2 states generated, 2 distinct states found, 1 states left on queue.
    2194:0 The depth of the complete state graph search is 2.
