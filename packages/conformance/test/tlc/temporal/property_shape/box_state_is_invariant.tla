    2190:0 Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at <date>.
    2110:1 Invariant Prop is violated.
    2121:1 The behavior up to this point is:
    2217:4 1: <Initial predicate>
    x = 0
    2217:4 2: <Next line 14, col 9 to line 14, col 27 of module box_state_is_invariant>
    x = 1
    2217:4 3: <Next line 14, col 9 to line 14, col 27 of module box_state_is_invariant>
    x = 2
    2199:0 3 states generated, 3 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
    2194:0 The depth of the complete state graph search is 3.
