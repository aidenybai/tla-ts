    2255:3 The formula Prop is a state-level formula, but it was used as a PROPERTY (or PROPERTIES), where a temporal formula is typically expected. State-level formulas used as PROPERTY or PROPERTIES are only checked in the initial state. To verify that the formula Prop holds in all states of every behavior, use INVARIANT Prop instead. Alternatively, applying the "always" temporal operator ([]) to the state-level formula Prop changes it into a temporal formula, asserting that Prop holds in all states of every behavior. See https://explain.tlapl.us/invariants-and-properties for additional details.
    2190:0 Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at <date>.
    2193:0 Model checking completed. No error has been found.
      Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
      because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
      calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.2E-19
    2199:0 4 states generated, 2 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
    2194:0 The depth of the complete state graph search is 2.
    2268:0 The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 1 and the 95th percentile is 1).
