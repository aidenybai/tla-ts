    2149:3 The invariant Inv is a constant-level formula (i.e., it contains no variables, primes, or temporal operators) and evaluates to TRUE. To assert constant-level formulas in your spec, use ASSUME ConstInv. If you optionally want to give the assumption a name, write ASSUME YourAssumption == ConstInv instead. See https://explain.tlapl.us/assumptions-and-invariants for additional details.
    2190:0 Finished computing initial states: 2 distinct states generated at <date>.
    2109:1 Successor state is not completely specified by the next-state action. The following variable is not defined: y.
    2121:1 The behavior up to this point is:
    2217:4 1: <Initial predicate>
    /\ x = 0
    /\ y = 0
    2217:4 2: <Next line 20, col 9 to line 20, col 14 of module space_whole_disjunction__unassigned__invariant_holds>
    /\ x = 0
    /\ y = null
    2199:0 3 states generated, 2 distinct states found, 1 states left on queue.
    2194:0 The depth of the complete state graph search is 1.
