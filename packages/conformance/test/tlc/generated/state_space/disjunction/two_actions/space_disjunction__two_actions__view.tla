    2191:0 Finished computing initial states: 2 states generated, with 1 of them distinct at <date>.
    2193:0 Model checking completed. No error has been found.
      Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
      because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
      calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.6E-19
    2199:0 4 states generated, 1 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
    2194:0 The depth of the complete state graph search is 1.
    2268:0 The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 0 (minimum is 0, the maximum 0 and the 95th percentile is 0).
