    2190:0 Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at <date>.
    1000:1 TLC threw an unexpected exception.
    This was probably caused by an error in the spec or model.
    See the User Output or TLC Console for clues to what happened.
    The exception was a java.lang.RuntimeException
    : The current version of TLC does not support action composition.  An incomplete implementation can be enabled via the tlc2.tool.impl.Tool.cdot=true java property.
    2121:1 The behavior up to this point is:
    2217:4 1: <Initial predicate>
    /\ x = 0
    /\ y = 0
    2103:1 The error occurred when TLC was evaluating the nested
    expressions at the following positions:
    0. Line 19, column 9 to line 19, column 51 in space_guard_first__composition__action_constraint
    2199:0 1 states generated, 1 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
    2194:0 The depth of the complete state graph search is 1.
